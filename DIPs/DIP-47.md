-----Summary of Proposal-----
The World of DeSci at DevCon Southeast Asia introduces decentralized science (DeSci) to the Web3 and Ethereum communities. As a key Community Hub, it brings together global DeSci leaders and researchers for collaboration, with complementary activities planned during the upcoming DESCI DAY event in Bangkok.

-----Abstract-----
Name: The World of DeSci - DevCon Southeast Asia
Website: desci.cc (under construction)
The World of DeSci at DevCon Southeast Asia is an initiative aimed at introducing the decentralized science (DeSci) movement to the broader Web3 and Ethereum communities to showcase the potential of Web3 technologies in transforming science into a public good. We aim to gather community leaders and project innovators in DeSci to meet and collaborate with the Devcon community, especially local SEA academics and researchers. This event is a precursor to the dedicated DESCI DAY event also held in Bangkok around the Devcon event. The DESCI DAY event will feature talks, workshops, a hackathon, and networking opportunities to engage developers, scientists, and enthusiasts from around the world.

Caption: During the event DESCI DAY: Buenos Aires 2024, the preproposal [(RFC) Pre-Proposal for the Community Hub: World of DeSci at DevCon Southeast Asia](https://forum.devcon.org/t/rfc-pre-proposal-for-the-community-hub-world-of-desci-at-devcon-southeast-asia/3646), published on June 28 in the forum, was mentioned as a significant step forward for the DeSci movement, highlighting the community's growing interest in decentralized science.

-----Motivation & Rationale-----
The decentralized science movement (DeSci) is still nascent and attracting builders and users to the space is an essential next step to achieving real impact in the fields of science and academia. By hosting a Hub at Devcon, we can expose new talent and existing researchers to the tools and models available in DeSci to improve their own workflows and experience in research. This event at DevCon will be a critical step in positioning DeSci as a key player in reshaping the scientific landscape, and attracting a diverse and global audience to the movement.

-----Implementation-----
To realize this vision, we will secure a dedicated space within the DevCon Southeast Asia venue for The World of DeSci. This space will facilitate:

* Global DeSci Community Interactions: The Hub is dedicated to fostering interactions between DeSci communities from various regions, including LATAM, Africa, Asia, and more, allowing them to a) share their unique challenges within science and academia, b) explore potential collaborations with existing projects.
* Education and Exposure: The Hub will facilitate exposure of projects to new eyes, and help builders understand the scope of DeSci, potentially inspiring them to build exciting new usecases outside of the typical DeFi/NFTs/Privacy/DID

Hype Generation for DESCI DAY: We will generate signups and excitement for the DESCI DAY event also in Bangkok during this period.

-----Operational Requirements & Ownership-----
Audio-Visual Equipment: Media team for content production

Workspace Setup: Stage, booths w/ TV screens, chairs, whiteboards, and power outlets Translation Services: Real-time translation services for non-English speaking participants to ensure inclusivity.

Promotional Materials: Banners, flyers, and digital content to promote the event and participating organizations.

**Team:**

This initiative is organized by the teams from DeSciWorld and DeSci LATAM, who have previously participated in events such as [DESCI DAY](https://lu.ma/lbq2zxh2?tk=8tSMiP), [The World of DeSci Belgrade](https://desci.world/belgrade), [DeSci CC Istanbul](https://23.labweek.io/desci-community-conference), [DeSci Builders Day SF](https://24.labweek.io/24-pg/schedule/calendar#desci-builders-day), [DeSci Summit Denver](https://summit.desci.community), among others, to spread DeSci around the world. Despite this, we are open to and welcome collaborations from other communities who share our vision for advancing decentralized science.

-----Links & Additional Information-----
Something else!
We aim to create a small section within the event for global DeSci communities such as LATAM, Thailand, Africa, Japan, Korea, China, Rio, etc., to interact with attendees. This space would foster contributor gathering and potential funding for unique scientific initiatives these communities face.

Join our proposal and letâ€™s help DeSci get to DevCon!
